= Description
  A library for playing and controlling sounds on MS Windows.

= Prerequisites
  * ffi
  * test-unit 2 (Development only)

= Installation
  gem install win32-sound

= Synopsis
  require 'win32/sound'
  include Win32

  # Play a wav file
  Sound.play("somefile.wav")

  # Play a system sound
  Sound.play("SystemAsterisk",Sound::ALIAS)

  # Get the current volume of the waveform-audio output device.
  p Sound.volume.join(", ") # left channel, right channel

= Acknowledgements
  API ideas derived (or not) from Perl's Win32::Sound module and Python's
  winsound package.

= Known Bugs
  None that I'm aware of. Please report any bugs on the project page
  at https://github.com/djberg96/win32-sound.
   
= Future Plans
  Add ability to retrieve information about WAV files.
  Add MIDI support?

= Developer's Notes
  The MessageBeep() function, which the Python "winsound" module contains,
  is intentionally omitted here. I felt it was redundant, because you can
  achieve the same effect with something like this:

    Sound.play("SystemAsterisk", Sound::ALIAS).
