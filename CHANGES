== 0.6.0 - 29-Jul-2014
* Added the play_freq method. This lets you play a frequency for a
  specified duration at a given volume. Big thanks go out to Dominic
  Muller for the patch.
* Reorganization of FFI related code into their own files.
* Updated the gem:create and gem:install rake tasks.

== 0.5.1 - 10-Apr-2013
* Updated HANDLE prototype in underlying FFI code. This affects
  64 bit versions of Ruby.

== 0.5.0 - 28-Jun-2012
* Now uses FFI instead of win32-api. This means it works with JRuby, too.
* Corresponding updates to the tests, Rakefile, gemspec, etc.
* Removed the Sound::Error exception class. If an underlying FFI function
  fails then a SystemCallError (Errno::XXX) is raised instead.

== 0.4.3 - 21-May-2011
* Refactored Rakefile, removing an old gem install task and adding a
  default task and a clean task.
* Altered the gemspec, including a platform change to 'universal-win32', and
  removed a deprecated specification method.

== 0.4.2 - 6-Aug-2009
* Changed the license to Artistic 2.0.
* Updated to use the Windows::Sound module from the windows-pr library.
* Fixed the Sound::ALIAS value. It was wrongly set to SND_ALIAS_ID.
* Several gemspec updates, including the license and description.
* The Sound.get_wave_volume method is now a true alias.
* Renamed the test file to test_win32_sound.rb.
* Renamed the example file to example_win32_sound.rb to avoid any possible
  confusion with actual test files.
* Added the 'example' rake task.

== 0.4.1 - 27-Jul-2007
* Changed SoundError to Sound::Error.
* Added a Rakefile with tasks for installation and testing.
* Removed the install.rb file. Installation is now handled via a rake task.
* Documentation updates.

== 0.4.0 - 26-Feb-2006
* Now pure Ruby only.
* Documentation updates and reorganization.
* Added a gemspec.
* Minor test suite changes.

== 0.3.0 - 29-May-2005
* Changed the Sound.volume= method (which didn't work) to
  Sound.set_wave_volume because it takes up to two values and only affects
  the wave volume, not the master volume.
* Renamed the Sound.volume method to Sound.wave_volume.
* Fixed a bug in the Sound.wave_volume method.
* Created the Sound.get_wave_volume alias for Sound.wave_volume.
* Fixed the Sound.set_wave_volume method.
* Test adjustments and additions to reflect API changes.
* Now Unicode friendly.
* Removed the sound.rd file.  The sound.txt file is now rdoc friendly.

== 0.2.1 - 1-Mar-2005
* Moved the 'examples' directory to the toplevel directory
* Made the CHANGES and README files rdoc friendly
* Some cleanup in sound.h.

== 0.2.0 - 13-Jul-2004
* Moved the SoundError class under the Win32 module namespace
* Replaced the deprecated STR2CSTR() function with the StringValuePtr()
  function.  This means that as of version 0.2.0, this package requires
  Ruby 1.8.0 or later.
* Moved the test.rb script to doc/examples
* Added the README file (oops).

== 0.1.0 - 14-Feb-2004
* Initial release
